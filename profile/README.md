# About 

`f-utils` is a Python framework designed to provide type safety and universal constructions.

# Principles

1. `function-first`: functions should be the main entities
2. `minimalism`: dependencies should be minimal and, while introduced, hardly justified
3. `constructivism`: define primitive entities and derive anything from them
4. `universality`: few operations for multiple types

# Interacting

1. General suggestions, questions, feature or lib request, and so on, could be added as issues in the [f-utils/.issues](https://github.com/f-utils/.issues).
2. Lib specific issues should also be in [f-utils/.issues](https://github.com/f-utils/).
3. Try also our [Coolab](https://discord.gg/waANUyCUGE) discord.
